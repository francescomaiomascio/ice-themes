# ICE Tests

## Canonical Validation Authority of the ICE Ecosystem

ICE Tests is the **validation authority** of the ICE ecosystem.

This repository does not merely test implementations. It defines and enforces the **structural, semantic, and cognitive constraints** that ICE must obey over time.

ICE Tests is where ICE is **proven**, not just exercised.

---

## Important Notice

ICE Tests is **not** a distributable package.

Do **not** run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

ICE Tests is a validation harness. It is executed exclusively via pytest and consumes the real ICE packages installed in the active environment.

Attempting to install this repository is considered a configuration error by design.

---

## Purpose

ICE is a modular system composed of:

- independent domains
- cooperative subsystems
- user-facing products
- long-running executions

ICE Tests exists to preserve:

- architectural intent
- semantic invariants
- cross-domain correctness
- long-term system identity

As ICE evolves, this repository ensures it does not drift.

---

## Scope of Authority

ICE Tests is authoritative over:

- domain-level correctness
- cross-domain interaction rules
- platform-level invariants
- product-level guarantees

**If a behavior is not validated here, it is not guaranteed by ICE.**

Documentation may explain. Code may execute. **Tests decide what is acceptable.**

---

## What This Repository Is

ICE Tests is:

- a semantic contract for ICE behavior
- a governance mechanism over system evolution
- a guardrail against architectural erosion
- a validation framework for large-scale refactoring

ICE Tests allows ICE to change without losing its identity.

---

## What This Repository Is Not

ICE Tests is not:

- a mirror of production repositories
- a collection of ad-hoc tests
- a playground for experiments
- a substitute for observability or monitoring

Tests here are:

- intentional
- declarative
- durable

**Convenience is not a goal.**

---

## Test Topology

ICE Tests is organized into four strictly separated layers:

### `domains/`
Local responsibility and isolated invariants

### `aggregates/`
Cooperative subsystems spanning multiple domains

### `core/`
ICE as a platform-level cognitive system

### `products/`
User-facing applications built on top of ICE

**Crossing layers within a single test is explicitly forbidden.**

Each layer answers a different class of questions.

---

## Design Principles

- Structure precedes implementation
- Semantics precede behavior
- Invariants precede features
- Tests define truth, not convenience

**If a test fails, the code is wrong — not the test.**

---

## Current Status

This repository is intentionally initialized with minimal executable tests.

At this stage:

- structure is finalized
- semantics are defined
- invariants are formalized

Test implementations are introduced incrementally, starting from domain contracts and expanding outward.

---

## Entry Points

### Documentation

- `docs/philosophy.md` — testing philosophy
- `docs/test-levels.md` — validation layers
- `docs/domain-boundaries.md` — what is tested where (and why)

### Execution

- `scripts/run_domain.sh`
- `scripts/run_aggregate.sh`
- `scripts/run_core.sh`
- `scripts/run_product.sh`

These scripts define the supported execution paths. Direct invocation outside these paths is discouraged.

---

## Canonical Status

**ICE Tests is normative.**

If ICE Tests becomes unclear, ICE itself has lost definition.

This repository exists to ensure that never happens.
